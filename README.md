# VIX-and-SPY

This project is producing an exploratory analysis of the realtionship between VIX (the implied volatility in the market) and the rate of retrn of SPY (an S&P 500 stock market index) per day between the years 1993 and 2018.

Looking at the graphs, one can see that the rate of return tends to be positive.  This means that on average the rate of return of the S&P 500 is positive.  The histograms tend to be skewed left showing that rates of return far from the average are more likely to be below to average.  This means that given a volatility, the market tends to go up more steadily and go down more dramtically.
